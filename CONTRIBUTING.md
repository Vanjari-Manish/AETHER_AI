# Grid Policy Orchestrator (GPO) — Phase 0.10 Development & Git Standards

This document establishes the official development, Git, and workflow standards for the Grid Policy Orchestrator (GPO) project. All developers, engineers, and contributors must adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure code quality, security compliance (NERC CIP), and system stability.

---

## 1. Development Philosophy

*   **Engineering-First Principles:** GPO is a mission-critical utility instrument. Code must be written with priority on correctness, predictability, and performance over convenience.
*   **Clean Architecture Mindset:** Maintain clear separation of concerns. UI layers must remain completely decoupled from core calculations, policy evaluation, and database queries.
*   **Maintainability & Readability:** Code is read far more often than it is written. Variable names must be explicit, functions must serve single purposes, and complex logic must be documented.
*   **Simplicity:** Avoid over-engineering. Rely on standard, proven design patterns (e.g., repository pattern, dependency injection) instead of custom frameworks.
*   **Scalability:** Design modules to run asynchronously where possible (e.g., telemetry processing, log exports) to handle scaling needs without locking main event loops.

```

---

## 3. Branch Strategy

*   **`main` Branch:** Represents the stable, production-ready release state. Direct commits are blocked. Deploys to the production cloud.
*   **`development` Branch:** The primary integration branch where feature branches merge. All automated integration tests run here.
*   **`feature/*` Branches:** Used to develop new features (e.g., `feature/policy-studio-compiler`). Branched from `development`, merged back via PR.
*   **`bugfix/*` Branches:** Used for standard bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/dnp3-packet-drop`). Branched from `development`, merged back via PR.
*   **`hotfix/*` Branches:** High-priority production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/auth-session-leak`). Branched directly from `main`, merged to both `main` and `development`.
*   **`release/*` Branches:** Pre-production staging builds (e.g., `release/v1.0.0-rc1`). Branched from `development` to freeze features for final validation.

---

## 4. Commit Message Convention

GPO follows Conventional Commits formatting: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.

### 4.1 Commit Types
*   `feat`: A new system feature or component.
*   `fix`: A bug fix.
*   `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features.
*   `docs`: Documentation updates only.
*   `style`: Formatting updates (missing semicolons, spacing, linting).
*   `test`: Adding or correcting tests.
*   `chore`: Tooling updates, dependency bumps, or config adjustments.
*   `perf`: Code changes improving calculation or execution speed.
*   `ci`: CI/CD pipeline or action script adjustments.
*   `build`: Changes affecting build systems or packaging configurations.

### 4.2 Commit Examples
*   `feat(policy): integrate syntax highlighter in rules text editor`
*   `fix(scada): resolve DNP3 pointer mismatch in telemetry loader`
*   `docs(api): document websocket parameters in API contract`
*   `test(agents): add unit check verifying consensus timeout trigger`
*   `refactor(db): optimize user-role junction table indexes`

---

## 5. Pull Request Standards

*   **PR Naming:** Prefixed with conventional type (e.g. `feat: add GIS weather overlays`).
*   **Required Description:** Must outline:
    1.  *Summary:* Purpose of the changes.
    2.  *Impact:* Affected components or database schemas.
    3.  *Manual Testing:* Steps taken to verify functionality.
*   **Linked Issues:** Must reference open tracking issues (e.g. `Closes #124`).
*   **Screenshots / Recordings:** Required for any visible UI modifications.
*   **Testing Checklist:** Verification that unit, integration, and security checks pass locally.
*   **Review Checklist:** Code style checks, security reviews, and verification of architectural alignment.
*   **Approval Process:** Requires approval from at least two senior engineers before merge eligibility.
*   **Merge Strategy:** Squashed and merged into `development` to maintain a clean git history.

---

## 6. Code Style Guidelines

*   **Formatting Consistency:** Enforce automatic formatting on save. Codebases must share identical spacing and styles.
*   **Readability Over Conciseness:** Write explicit code. Avoid obscure syntax.
*   **Function Size Limits:** Keep functions focused on a single task. Functions should not exceed 50 lines of code.
*   **File Size Limits:** Files should focus on a single concern, keeping size under 400 lines of code.
*   **Class Design:** Apply SOLID principles. Favor composition over inheritance.
*   **Error Handling:** Never swallow exceptions. Wrap external network calls in try-catch-finally blocks, ensuring system resources are cleared.
*   **Comments:** Write comments explaining *why* a particular approach was taken for complex operations, rather than *what* the code does.
*   **Documentation:** Functions, classes, and APIs must feature clear docstrings outlining input parameters, return types, and exceptions.

---

## 7. Linting Standards

*   **Static Analysis:** Enforce linting checks (e.g., ESLint, Ruff) during local development and CI stages to block invalid syntax.
*   **Unused Code Detection:** Unused variables, empty imports, and dead functions must be detected and removed before pull requests are submitted.
*   **Import Ordering:** Group imports cleanly:
    1.  Core language imports (React, Python packages).
    2.  External third-party libraries.
    3.  Internal components, utilities, and assets.
*   **Consistency Policies:** Lint rules must check code format patterns, variable definitions, and type checks to maintain codebase consistency.

---

## 8. Formatting Standards

*   **Code Formatter:** Prettier (or language equivalent) runs automatically on save.
*   **Indentation:** Locked to 2 spaces for frontend code (TypeScript, HTML, CSS), and 4 spaces for backend code (Python, Julia). Tabs are prohibited.
*   **Line Length limits:** Keep lines under 120 characters to improve legibility on split-screen displays.
*   **Quotes:** Double quotes (`"`) for TypeScript and HTML, single quotes (`'`) for Python string declarations (unless containing quotes).
*   **Semicolons:** Required in TypeScript/JavaScript; omitted in Python.
*   **Spacing:** Enforce single spaces around operators, parameters, and block brackets.
*   **Trailing Commas:** Required on multi-line objects, arrays, and parameter declarations to minimize git diff line noise.

---

## 9. Naming Conventions

*   **Files:** PascalCase for React component files (`GridMap.tsx`), lowercase kebab-case for assets and scripts (`dnp3_handler.py`).
*   **Folders:** Lowercase kebab-case across all directories (e.g. `/src-frontend/shared-components`).
*   **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `SubstationDetailsDrawer`).
*   **Functions:** camelCase for TypeScript (`calculateLoad`), snake_case for Python (`verify_constraints`).
*   **Variables:** camelCase for TypeScript, snake_case for Python.
*   **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g. `MAX_VOLTAGE_LIMIT`).
*   **Interfaces & Types:** PascalCase, descriptive names (e.g., `GridNodeProperties`).
*   **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `TelemetryBrokerConnection`).
*   **APIs:** Lowercase kebab-case URL path parameters (e.g. `/api/v1/grid-assets`).
*   **Database Entities:** Plural snake_case for tables (`audit_logs`); singular snake_case for fields (`user_id`).
*   **Environment Variables:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE prefixed by environment name (e.g. `GPO_DB_PASSWORD`).

---

## 10. Folder Organization

*   **Feature-Based Organization:** Group modules by functional domains (e.g., `/features/policy-editor`).
*   **Shared Modules:** Common resources (shared helpers, base classes) are isolated in root shared folders to prevent circular dependencies.
*   **Assets:** Static files (SVG markers, brand icons) are kept in dedicated asset directories.
*   **Components:** Reusable UI elements are stored in `/components` directories.
*   **Services:** Classes wrapping external APIs (e.g. database gateways, email servers) are isolated from layout views.
*   **Utilities:** Pure helper functions (formatters, mathematical calculators) are kept in `/utils`.
*   **Hooks:** Custom React state managers are isolated in `/hooks`.
*   **Context:** Global view states are kept in `/context` or `/store`.
*   **Configuration:** Platform settings, constants, and logging rules are kept in `/config`.
*   **Tests:** Kept in adjacent directories named `/tests` matching the structure of the target code.

---

## 11. Environment Variables

*   **Naming Conventions:** Standard SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE using a subsystem prefix (e.g. `GPO_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`).
*   **Public vs Private:** 
    *   *Public:* UI configuration variables (prefixed with `PUBLIC_` or `REACT_APP_`).
    *   *Private:* DB credentials, private security tokens, and encryption keys.
*   **Secrets Management:** Secrets must never be committed to git repositories. Staging and production secrets are injected at runtime using secure container vault systems.
*   **Local Development:** Loaded from local `.env.example` templates, copied to a git-ignored `.env` file.
*   **Staging & Production:** Loaded directly from container environments managed by the deployment gateway.

---

## 12. Documentation Standards

*   **README Updates:** Major feature updates require updates to the root README, covering installation instructions, dependencies, and parameters.
*   **Inline Documentation:** Complex logic, workarounds, or regulatory checks must feature comments explaining the implementation rationale.
*   **API Documentation:** Changes to API routes require updates to the API specifications.
*   **Architecture Documentation:** System design changes must be documented in the technical architecture specifications.
*   **Change Logs:** Commits are compiled into a central CHANGELOG markdown file at each release, listing updates, fixes, and security patches.

---

## 13. Testing Standards

*   **Unit Testing:** Focuses on pure functions, validation logic, and utility algorithms. Target code coverage: 90%.
*   **Integration Testing:** Verifies connections between services, database queries, and multi-agent negotiations. Target code coverage: 80%.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulates user flows (e.g. login, scenario execution, manual overrides) on staging builds.
*   **Coverage Expectations:** Pull requests are blocked if code coverage drops below systemic baselines.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Test files must match the target file name with a `.test` suffix (e.g. `rule_compiler.test.py`).
*   **Test Organization:** Test suites are kept in adjacent `/tests` directories matching the structure of the target modules.

---

## 14. Code Review Checklist

During review, code must be evaluated against the following criteria:
*   **Readability:** Is the code clean and understandable? Do variables use descriptive names?
*   **Performance:** Are database queries indexed? Are memory leak loops prevented?
*   **Security:** Are user inputs validated? Are database queries parameterized?
*   **Accessibility:** Does the interface support WCAG AA requirements? Are color blind safety markers present?
*   **Error Handling:** Are exceptions caught and logged? Are fail-safe configurations defined?
*   **Testing:** Are unit and integration tests present? Does coverage match baselines?
*   **Documentation:** Are functions and classes documented? Are inline explanations clear?
*   **Architecture Compliance:** Does the implementation follow clean architecture principles? Is UI logic decoupled from system calculations?

---

## 15. Security Best Practices

*   **Secret Handling:** Never hardcode secrets. Ensure credentials are loaded from system environment variables at runtime.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities. Update packages containing known exploits.
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize user inputs at boundary limits. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections.
*   **Logging Security:** Ensure user passwords, session tokens, and keys are masked in logs.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Verify access tokens at the API gateway. Verify user role permissions for all mutating endpoints.
*   **Sensitive Data Protection:** Encrypt personal data at rest using AES-256 keys, and in transit using TLS 1.3.
